DEPLOYING A DATABASE SCRIPT

When you are ready to deploy the application, run the following command to get a SQL script of all your migrations:
	Update-Database -Script -SourceMigration:0

This command generates the SQL script from the very first migration to the last one.
In a real-world scenario, you may want to change the range of migrations included in the SQL script in each deployment.

To do this, you can use:
	Update-Database -Script -SourceMigration:Migr1 -TargetMigration:Migr2
